Runescape bot which uses color-detection on object markers in RuneLite

## Dependencies

* Node.js v16.13.1

## Notes:
As of now it is poorly tested and may fail randomly because the script is dependent on finding edges of the initially detected color.

# Usage
* Install RuneLite, activate the Mark-object plugin
* Shift+Right-click to mark objects
* Place application in top left corner (will create script for this later)
* Run index.js
* Script will detect cyan (00ffff) color and edges nearby, then clicking with spread
